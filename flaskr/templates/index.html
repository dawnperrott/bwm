  <p>The Beer With Me application started in a small two bedroomed apartment in Limerick.
    After a long night of general debauchery, plenty of merriment and many bottles of bland tasteless beer, we decided enough was enough. Something had to be done. Life was too short to drink bad beer. The next morning, while nursing a spectacular hangover we decided to set out in making an application. That highlights the best of beer!
    There is a rich brewing history in Ireland and it is engrained in our DNA. We felt it was our job to spread the word.</p>
  <p>We offer comprehensive information on pubs in Limerick. Find the best venues, deals and events wherever you are, whenever you want. Search for venues by name or just browse for pubs close by on the interactive map. Looking for something to do?
